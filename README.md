# everything-about-a-voxel
I want to make a minecraft like terrain for a game. If I were to make thousands of unity cubes, my computer comes to a crawl. How do you do it? We are going to have to learn about a thing called a voxel. We make cube mesh in a C# script. We will make a smooth voxel where the vertices are shared. We will make a flat voxel where each of the 6-sides has the same normal. And then we will learn how to make and use a material on our voxel that has a different picture (or texture) on the sides.
